# SoulDOS

## What is SoulDOS?

SoulDOS is a compatibility layer for Vintix that intercepts DOS system calls and translates them into native Vintix calls. It lets you run DOS applications **natively**

## What's the Point?

Because running legacy DOS software shouldn’t risk your whole system.  
SoulDOS sandboxes those old programs so they can’t crash your OS or do sketchy stuff.

## What's the Goal?

Simple: run DOS software on Vintix with the same or better performance than real DOS — but with modern security and stability.  
No hype. No layers of crap. Just a tool that works.

## Why?

Why not?
