# How to use IO/OUT?

## Introduction

Well, in the start of Vintix, I was using my own custom IO headers. It worked fine for me, but it wasn't very flexible or extensible. So I decided to just port Musl LibC to Vintix and on commit `1f89d5b7b2c89c5e18b553b0dc5e15d189701ff0`, I started porting the Musl LibC to the code.
